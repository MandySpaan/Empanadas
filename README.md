# Assignment summary

The goal of this project was to calculate how to achieve the best deal for an empanada promotion. The following factors had to be taken into consideration:

- Promotion: get 3, pay only 1
- The 1 to be paid is the most expensive of 3
- You can buy a maximum of 40 empanadas
- The total of empanadas has to be dividable by 3
- There are 3 different options, priced €12, €14 & €16
- You can combine the empanadas ordering half / half:
  - For example: if you have 1x €12, 1x €14 and 1x €16 <br>
    Then 1x €12 and 1x €16 can be combined to reach<br>
    a lower price of the most expensive empanada:<br>
    - 0.5x €12 + 0.5x €16 = a new empanada worth €14<br>
      which when ordered twice has the same content<br>
      So 1x €12 and 1x €16 can be turned into 2x €14<br>
      By making this combination, in the example, the highest <br>
      price (and thus the best deal) became €14 instead of €16.
