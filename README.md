## Assignment üìù

The goal of this project was to calculate how to achieve the best deal for an empanada promotion. <br>
The following factors had to be taken into consideration:

- Promotion: get 3, pay only 1
- The 1 to be paid is the most expensive of a group of 3
- You can buy a maximum of 40 empanadas in total
- The total of empanadas has to be dividable by 3
- There are 3 different options, priced ‚Ç¨12, ‚Ç¨14 & ‚Ç¨16
- You can combine the empanadas ordering half / half:
  - For example: if you have 1x ‚Ç¨12, 1x ‚Ç¨14 and 1x ‚Ç¨16 <br>
    Then 1x ‚Ç¨12 and 1x ‚Ç¨16 can be combined to reach<br>
    a lower price of the most expensive empanada:<br>
    - 0.5x ‚Ç¨12 + 0.5x ‚Ç¨16 = a new empanada worth ‚Ç¨14<br>
      which when ordered twice has the same content<br>
      So 1x ‚Ç¨12 and 1x ‚Ç¨16 can be turned into 2x ‚Ç¨14<br>
      By making this combination, in the example, the highest <br>
      price (and thus the best deal) became ‚Ç¨14 instead of ‚Ç¨16.

The following repository was cloned to be used a starting point: [the Empanada Challenge](https://github.com/GeeksHubsAcademy/javascript-empanadas-challenge).<br>
This repository includes the following initial files:

- A main.js file with an empty function that takes 3 parameters (a, b, c)
  - These parameters represent the quantity of empanadas <br>
    (a) respresents priced at ‚Ç¨12, (b) at ‚Ç¨14 and (c) at ‚Ç¨16
- A main.test.js file that holds the tests that need to be completed

## My thought process üí≠

The overall idea of how to get to the desired result:

- Step 1: Translate the given input properties <i>(a, b, c)</i> into an array of items, where each item represents an empanada named as it's own price: <i>arrayEmpanadas</i>.
- Step 2: Take <i>arrayEmpanadas</i> with the original prices and calculate the possible combinations to get to a new outcome of price per empanada. The new price per empanada has to turn the highest prices as low as possible. Then place these new prices into a new array: <i>combinedPrices</i>.
- Step 3: Take the array <i>combinedPrices</i> and organize the order of its content (new price per empanada) from highest to lowest.
- Step 4: From this now organized array <i>combinedPrices</i>, select chronologically every first of groups of three, and put this into a new array: <i>toBePaid</i>. This array now includes all the empanadas that have to be paid.
- Step 5: Add all the items from the <i>toBePaid</i> together to come to the final price.
